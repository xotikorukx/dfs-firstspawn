# dfs-firstspawn
Allows you as a serverowner to remove all cfx-default resources except baseevents and optionally chat.

**Notes**
- If you have a solid queue system, it should have already taken over hardcap's job. Check your queue system to make sure it does if your server is already big enough for this to be a concern.
- This is a drag-n-drop resource, just make sure you have removed all cfx-default reosurces except baseevents and optionally chat before testing it on your server.
- Some QB resources (looking at you, ambulancejob) call an export in spawnmanager. You can just remove this line from ambulancejob to no negative effect (assuming you are running this script)
